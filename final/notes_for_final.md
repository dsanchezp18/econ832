## Notes about the Choice Prediction Competition 2018

*Behavioral decision research highlights interesting choice anomalies and proposes elegant models that can explain these phenomena. Thus, it seems reasonable that this type of research would provide a solid base for development of useful predictive models of choice. In practice, however, it is often easier to predict behavior with data-driven machine learning tools that do not rely on the behavioral decision-making literature.*

- ML better than behavioural science in predicting choice.

- One reason for the difficulty in deriving general predictions using the elegant behavioral models is that different models are often proposed to explain different phenomena.
