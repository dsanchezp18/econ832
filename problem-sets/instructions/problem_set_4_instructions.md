# Problem Set 4

Go to the `NN/ABKKExperiment_pilot.jl` and use it as a basis for you own model, familiarize yourself with the dataset.

## Tasks:

1. Do your own model on the original dataset and make a report with your choices of every part of the neural net, layers, width, activation functions, loss, optimiser, and the outcomes.

2. Report loss and accuracy for in sample and test sample.

3. Then focus only on binary menus in the dataset, binary menus, and try to predict choices on that subsample of lotteries.

4. Make an analysis of the differences of the model of linear mixture in my QE paper with the neural net what is common and what is different advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

5. More daring: How can you learn about risk aversion from your neural net analysis?
